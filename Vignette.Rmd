```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Vignette

```{r casestotal}
summary(casestotal)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r deathstotal, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(deathstotal)
```

## Showing Dataframe Creation

```{r casesdf}
sortedcases<-sort(casestotal, decreasing = TRUE)
top10<-sortedcases[1:10]
names<-c("USA", "Spain", "Italy", "France", "Germany", "UK", "Turkey", "Iran", "China", "Russia")
casesdf<-data.frame(top10, names)
```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
